# Getting started

## Get started with a template

The easiest way to get started is to use one of the templates.
All templates include required dependencies and pre-configured settings.
Some templates also include additional features like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/),
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), etc.

All templates include only `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/hooks` packages,
if you need additional `@mantine/*` packages follow installation instructions
of the package you want to use.

To get started with a template, open it on GitHub and click on the "Use this template"
button. Note that you need to be logged in to your GitHub account to use this feature.

## Framework guide

Follow one of the guides below to get started with Mantine in your preferred framework.
Note that usually it is better to get started with a template. Use guides if you want
to add Mantine to an existing project or if enjoy doing things manually.

## Get started without framework

<PackagesInstallation />

Install PostCSS plugins and [postcss-preset-mantine](/styles/postcss-preset):

<InstallScript packages="postcss postcss-preset-mantine postcss-simple-vars" dev />

Create `postcss.config.js` file at the root of your application with the following content:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-preset-mantine': {},
    'postcss-simple-vars': {
      variables: {
        'mantine-breakpoint-xs': '36em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-sm': '48em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-md': '62em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-lg': '75em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-xl': '88em',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Wrap your application with [MantineProvider](/theming/mantine-provider/):

```tsx
import { MantineProvider, createTheme } from '@mantine/core';

const theme = createTheme({
  /** Put your mantine theme override here */
});

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

If your application has server side rendering, add [ColorSchemeScript](/theming/color-schemes)
to the `<head />` of your application:

```tsx
import { ColorSchemeScript } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>My awesome app</title>

        <ColorSchemeScript />
      </head>
      <body>
        <App />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

All set! Now you can use Mantine components in your application.
